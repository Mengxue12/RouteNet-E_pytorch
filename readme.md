## Project Description

This project aims to implement the pytorch version of [RouteNet-Erlang](https://github.com/BNN-UPC/RouteNet-Erlang), which makes use of GNN architecture to model computer networks.

### Dataset
There are two datasets for models: traffic and scheduling.
You can download the datasets here:
- [Traffic Dataset](https://bnn.upc.edu/download/dataset-v5-traffic-models/)
- [Scheduling Dataset](https://bnn.upc.edu/download/dataset-v5-scheduling/)
